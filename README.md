# Project Structure
The project follows a monorepo structure with separate backend and frontend directories. The backend uses MVC architecture with controllers handling business logic, routes defining API endpoints, middleware for authentication and authorization, models for database operations, and utilities for common functions. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool, with components organized by feature and shared utilities in the lib directory.
