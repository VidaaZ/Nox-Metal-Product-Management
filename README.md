Nox Metal Product Management

A full-stack product management system I built to learn modern web development. It's a simple but complete app that handles user authentication, product management, and audit logging.

What I Built

This is a product catalog where users can browse products, and admins can add/edit/delete them. I wanted to build something practical that covers the main concepts I was learning.

Key Features
- User login/signup - Regular users can browse, admins can manage
- Product management - Add products with images, edit, delete, restore
- Search & filtering - Find products easily
- Audit trail - Track who did what and when
- Responsive design- Works on mobile and desktop

Tech Stack

 Backend
-Node.js + Express - API server
-TypeScript - Type safety (still learning this)
-MongoDB - Database (using Atlas for hosting)
-JWT - Authentication
-Multer - File uploads for product images

Frontend  
-React 19 - UI framework
-TypeScript - Type safety
-Vite - Build tool (much faster than CRA)
-Context API - State management 

Demo: https://nox-metal-product-management.vercel.app/auth
Admin login: admin@example.com / admin123

Challenges I Faced

-CORS configuration - Took me a while to get PATCH requests working
-Image uploads - Had to figure out how to serve static files
-Deployment - Deploying in two different host of Railway and Vercel was interesting


This was a fun project to build! I learned a lot about full-stack development and deployment. Feel free to check out the code or try the live demo.
